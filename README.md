# Master-Thesis-Latex-RWU
Master Thesis Latex format with new Styling for Hochschule Ravensburg - Weingarten for Linux users.

These files have been modified for a thesis report. The original files for this styling have been created by Mr. Stefan Gast.
This project contains RWU LaTeX style packages, using the Barlow font family
and the RWU colors.
It is mainly meant for usage in official RWU documents, like exercise sheets,
lecture notes and forms.

If you are a student and plan to use these packages in your project
documentation or in your thesis, please talk to your supervising professor
first and ask her or him about the expected style.
These documents are your work and not necessarily subject to the corporate
design of the RWU.
Furthermore, expected styles differ between professors.



Use commands in ```script.sh``` file to generate bibliography and abbreviations files.

Otherwise just run 
```make```
in directory latex-rwustyle-master.
